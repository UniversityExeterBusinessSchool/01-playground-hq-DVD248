# My Structure - Student 02

## What I See in My Data
The data shows repeated H symbols, a height of 1, a width of 8, a single row type, and the color blue.

## What I Think This Means
This means the structure is one brick tall and made of eight blue bricks placed in a straight line.

## What This Could Be
This could represent a balance beam or a simple walkway in a playground.

## Questions I Have
I don’t know how this structure connects to others or what its exact purpose is.
